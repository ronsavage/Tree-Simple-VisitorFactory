	- No code changes.
	- Fix my licence (sic) mess so all references are to Perl. This involves edits to Makefile.PL

	- Fix Makefile.PL so modules only used for testing are in TEST_REQUIRES and not PREREQ_PM.
		See RT#113948. Thanx Kent Fredric.
	- Fix README so it more-or-less conforms to the Perl Foundation's guidelines at
		http://www.perlfoundation.org/cpan_licensing_guidelines.
